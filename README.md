This project focuses on identifying key cardiovascular risk factors using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a heart disease dataset, we train and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various clinical attributes.
**🚀 Objective:**
To develop a machine learning model that can help predict the presence of heart disease using patient data. This aids in early diagnosis and improves healthcare interventions for at-risk individuals.
**🧠 Machine Learning Approach**
  Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
  Problem Type: Binary Classification
  Target Variable: target (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)

**📊 Dataset Overview**
Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Rows: ~1026
Columns: 13 features + 1 target
Features Include:age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, and target

**🛠️ Libraries Used**
pandas, numpy – data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization
sklearn – model building, training, and evaluation

**🧪 Steps Performed**
1.Data Loading and Exploration
  ->Dataset preview, shape, and missing value check
2.Visualization
  ->Correlation heatmap
  ->Target variable distribution
  ->Boxplot of age vs. heart disease presence
3.Preprocessing
  ->Mapping and encoding of categorical values
  ->Splitting data into training and test sets
  ->Standardizing the features
4.Model Training
  ->Using a Random Forest Classifier
5.Evaluation
  ->Accuracy score
  ->Confusion matrix
  ->Classification report
6.Feature Importance
  ->Identify which features influence the prediction most

**📈 Results**
Achieved high accuracy on the test data
Key features influencing heart disease predictions were identified
Confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into model performance

**💡 Insights**
Certain features such as cp (chest pain type), thalach (maximum heart rate), and oldpeak (ST depression) are strongly associated with heart disease.

Random Forest showed robust performance with minimal overfitting due to proper standardization and train-test split.
